    "# Introduction to Databases and Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "As Data Scientists, you will frequently want to store data in an organized, structured manner that allows you to do complex queries.  Because you are good Data Scientists, [**you do not use Excel!!!**](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will only discuss **Relational Databases**, because those are the most common in bioinformatics.  (There are other kinds!!).  So when I say \"database\" I mean \"relational database\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are used to store information in a manner that, when used properly, is:\n",
    "  a) highly structured\n",
    "  b) constrained (i.e. detects errors)\n",
    "  c) transactional (i.e. can undo a command if it discovers a problem)\n",
    "  d) indexed (for speed of search)\n",
    "  e) searchable\n",
    "  \n",
    "The core concept of a database is a **Table**.  Tables contain one particular \"kind\" of information (e.g. a Table could represent a Student, a University, a Book, or a portion of a Clinical Record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables contain **Rows** and **Columns** where, generally, every column represents a \"feature\" of that information (e.g. a Student table might have **[\"name\", \"gender\", \"studentID\", \"age\"]** as its columns/features).  Every row represents an \"individual\", and their values for each feature (e.g. a Row in a Student table might have **[\"Mark Wilkinson\", \"M\", \"163483\", \"35\"]** as its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Database may have many Tables that represent various kinds of related information.  For example, a library database might have a Books table, a Publishers table, and a Locations table.  A Book has a Publisher, and a Location, so the tables need to be connected to one another.  This is achieved using **keys**.  Generally, every row (individual) in a table has a unique identifier (generally a number), and this is called its **key**.  Because it is unique, it is possible to refer unambiguously to that individual record.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the easiest way to learn about databases and SQL is to start building one!  We will use the MySQL Docker Container that we created in the previous lesson.  We are going to create a Germplasm database (seed stocks).  It will contain information about the seed (its amount, its harvest date, its location), the germplasm (its species, the allele it carries), and about the genetics related to that allele (the gene_id, the gene name, the protein name, and a link to the GenBank record)\n",
    "\n",
    "(if that Docker Container isn't running, please **docker start course-mysql** now!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:  This Jupyter Notebook is running the Python kernel.  This allows us to use some nice tools in Python (the sql extension and SqlMagic) that provide access to the mysql database server from inside of the Notebook.  You don't need to know any Python to do this.  Note also that you can do exactly the same commands in your Terminal window.**\n",
    "\n",

If you do, then your germplasm table is linked through the stock_id to a stock that no longer exists.  If you gather more seed in the future, is that the same stock?  (answer:  NO, it is not!!!).... so do you update the existing stock record to say there is now 10g of seed?  \n",
