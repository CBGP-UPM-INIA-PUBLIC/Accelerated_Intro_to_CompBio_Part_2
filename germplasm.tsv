AT1G01040	CS3828	Increased abundance of miRNA precursors.	17369351
AT1G01060	lhy-101	The mutant plants are hypersensitive to both FRc and Rc light treatments in hypocotyl elongation and exhibits a small reciprocal enlargement in cotyledon area, albeit not statistically significant.	16891401
AT1G01140	SALK_058629	hypersensitive to low potassium media	17486125
AT1G01220	SALK_012400C	fkgp-1 mutants have about 40 times more L-fucose than wild type Arabidopsis plants, but the levels of other monosaccharides do not appear to differ significantly in the mutants. No obvious phenotypic abnormalities were observed in the fkgp-1 mutants, nor were any differences in the sugar composition of cell wall polysaccharides detected.	18199744
AT1G01280	SALK_119582	Slightly longer inflorescences, an extended period of blooming, a reduced number of elongated siliques, and overall reduced seed set. About a third of the siliques failed to develop. Pollen was not developed (lower and middle AT1G01510	an-2	Phenotype not described.	11889033

AT2G03800	gek1-1	Ethanol hypersensitivity.	15215505
AT2G04240	xerico	Resistant to exogenous ABA. Seeds contained lower amounts of endogenous ABA than wildtype.	17933900
AT2G05210	pot1-1	No visible phenotype.	17627276
AT3G02130	rpk2-2	The homozygous progeny is indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth but showed several morphological alterations after bolting. These plants displayed enhanced inflorescence branching and formed three times as many siliques and flowers as did wild-type plants.	17419837
AT3G02140	afp4-1	Decreased germination on high concentrations of glucose and sorbitol.	18484180
AT3G02230	rgp1-1	rgp1-1 mutants have significantly lower levels of UDP-L-arabinose mutase activity compared to wild-type plants and significantly lower levels of arabinose in their cell walls.	21478444
AT3G02260	tir3-1 RGLG1:rglg1 rglg2	The triple homozygous progeny has low viability, accumulated anthocyanin, and all plants died before shoot emergence.	17586653
AT3G02310	sep2-1	Non-described subtle phenotype.	10821278
AT3G02680	atnbs1-1	Significantly smaller when grown in the presence of methyl methanosulfonate (MMS) with root growth.  Normal growth under standard growth conditions.	17672843
AT3G02850	CS3816	The skor-1 mutant is sensitive to toxic cations in addition to K+ depletion.	17568770

AT4G14790	pdd17	Defective pollen development.	19237690
AT4G15210	bmy1-2	Plants cold-shocked for 6h have an increased starch content compared to wildtype.	16297066
AT4G15560	cla1-1	Mutant seeds grown on medium supplemented with non-phosphorylated synthetic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX) develop green leaves.	10982425
AT4G15570	maa3	Homozygotes are not recovered. Female gametophyte development is delayed and asynchronous. During fertilization, fusion of polar nuclei does not occur. Polar nuclei nucloeli are smaller than WT.	18772186
AT4G15802	Athspb-2	Early flowering, reduced fertility, aborted seeds.	20388662
AT4G15880	esd4-2	Decreased mRNA levels of the floral repressors FLC and MAF4 and increased mRNA levels of the floral activators FT and SOC1.	17513499

AT5G10480	pas2-3	Segregates 25% embryo lethal.	18799749
AT5G10510	plt3-1	Short roots and shortened root meristem.	17960244
AT5G11110	kns2	Defects are specific to pollen exine structure. Smaller mesh size in the exine structure. Increased number of baculae. Fully fertile.	18779216
AT5G11260	hy5-101	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is increased compared to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is also increased and the cotyledon area is smaller.	16891401
AT5G11510	myb3r4-1	No visible phenotype.	17287251
AT5G12200	pyd2-2	The pyd2-2 mutant has a wild-type appearance under normal growth conditions. Pyrimidine nucleotide and uridine levels are not changed in the mutant, but uracil levels are increased. These mutants cannot grow normally when uracil is provided as a sole nitrogen source.	19413687
AT5G13290	crn-1	Increased meristem size. Vegetative meristems are are 30% larger than wild type. After bolting inflorescence meristems are enlarged and occasionally fasciated. Flowers occasionally produce extra organs in the first 3.	12345678
